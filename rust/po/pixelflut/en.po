"Available subcommands are:\n"
"HELP\t- This help message\n"
"SIZE\t- Get the current canvas size\n"
"PX\t\t- Get or Set one specific pixel color\n"
"STATE\t- Get the whole canvas in a specific binary format\n"
"\n"
"All commands end with a newline character (\\n) and need to be sent as a UTF-8 encoded string (numbers as well).\n"
"Responses are always newline terminated as well.\n"
"More help ist available with 'HELP $subcommand'"

"Gets or sets the pixel color addressed by the coordinates $x and $y.\n"
"The mode of operation is determined by the third argument ($rgb) being present or not.\n"
"If it is present, the pixel will be set to that color.\n"
"If it is not present, the current color will only be returned.\n"

"$x\t- X position on the canvas counted from the left side.\n"
"$y\t- Y position on the canvas counted from the top.\n"
"$rgb\t- HEX encoded rgb format without # symbol (000000 - FFFFFF)."

"Each pixel is encoded into 3 bytes for the color values red, green and blue.\n"
"These bytes are then simply appended to each other in row-major-order.\n"
